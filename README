Here is a base repository for the sanitized configurations of every system I 
manage.  Personalization data should be stored elsewhere. This entire 
repository is meant to be checked out to your puppetmaster, or cfengine policy
host and copied into masterfiles or the puppet config file repository.

Note that this information should be generic, and system specific (personalization) 
data should be in a meta-data repository elsewhere. I prefer LDAP, but really anything
that you can query remotely would work. 

A private git repository would work as well, and that's what I start out with until the 
LDAP servers are deployed.
