This directory holds sub-directories of base-system layouts:

A base-system is defined as:
    - host prerequisites (the minimum host config to which this may be applied)
    - disk prerequisites (the minimum disk configuration to which this may be applied)
    - disk partitioning scheme (including any special device issues LVM/RAID/crypto)
    - source_media (the source media required to make the base install)
    - packages (the packages from said media required to create the base install)
    - strings (the work objects that need to be applied to the system to create it)

The strings included in a base_system should be the minimum required to:
    - secure the system
    - add the configuration management agents

From here, configuration management strings will be applied to the system to (un)configure the system

This directory is meant to be used by your deployment system, be it a kickstart server, cobbler,
fai, unattended or whatever your poison is.
