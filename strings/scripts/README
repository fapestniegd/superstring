Use this directory only to bootstrap your configuration management system and 
to secure the initial deployment.  If you don't, you'll undoubtedly end up 
replicating work in here and in the configuration management directories. 

Installation should be about Partitioning, deployig the base system, securing
the base system, and bootstrapping the configuration management system, any 
install system that does more than that is overstepping it's role and adding 
redundant work (IMHO, discussion/arguments always welcome, preferably over beer).

Besides, not replicating work is what this project is all about.
